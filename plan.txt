1.First I think what to change in my room.
1.Second I would remove every furniture in my room or in area where i gonna do a renovation, to prevent any damage on my furniture. 
And also to have some space to move around.
2.Thirdly I draw a lines on my wall for mark where i want to do something for example make a hole for a door. Or make a 
sketch on paper to remember what i want to do.
3.And for the last part I prepare tools and i check if i have enough materials then start the renovation.
